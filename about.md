I am Ehouarn Perret, a French Software Developer who likes living abroad =]

I like coding, sharing my joys, my sorrows and whathever I found or created in order to make coding painless.

I am naturally curious and when time allows I am always eager to learn new things, from Machine Learning to Natural Language Processing through Cooking.

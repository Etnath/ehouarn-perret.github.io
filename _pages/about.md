# Hi there!

I am Ehouarn Perret, a modest Software Developer who is naturally curious about pretty much everything.

When time allows, I am always eager to learn new things, from new programming languages to nuclear fusion through cooking or NLP and then, indeed forget what I have just learned =o... because we all do after all and there is nothing to be ashamed of =]

That's why I created this github.io, it gathers stuff that I often forget (and damn you cannot imagine how much I can forget), sometimes it's super useful and sometimes... well not really but you know I mean ^^'.

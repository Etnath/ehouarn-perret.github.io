Well this is a first post using Jekyll published on Github Pages. 

Honestly, I did not bother myself too much and just modified the provided post, that's probably why it looks kind of empty.

By the way, it seems Jekyll has a nice syntax highlighting support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

However it seems there is a lack of line numbers, I'm pretty sure there are already some proper workarounds out there.

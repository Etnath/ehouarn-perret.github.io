Well this is a first post written using Jekyll and published on Github Pages. 

Honestly, I did not bother myself too much and just modified the provided post, that's probably why it looks kind of empty.

Anyway, so far, so good it after some buderns of setting up my local environment under Windows, I can finally start blogging.

Jekyll has a nice syntax highlighting support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

However it seems there is a lack of line numbers, I'm pretty sure there are already some proper workarounds out there.

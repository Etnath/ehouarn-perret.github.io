This is a first post part of a short series about how to prepare some Microsoft Certifications.


# My opinion about certifications
Let me make this  clear I don't think certifications are making in any way a developer better at coding. So I do not think that they are in any manner, necesserary. 

As a matter of fact, in the past I used to be an interviewer for a couple of .NET developer positions in my previous company and among the candidates there were some people who passed the certifications were not necesserarily the best ones, technically-speaking. Honestly I do not care that much about the degree BSc, MSc CS or not, what matter the most to me is being competent at programming. So it may happen that scanning a candidate's Github profile and have a look at his or her repositories in order to find out whether he or she is capable progamming-wise.

However, despise the fact that the certifications (whether they are issued or not by Microsoft) are (hopefully) not necesserary to be competent at coding, they can still somehow help you to land on your new job. Sometimes, recruiters or HRs are most likely to find you on say LinkedIn when you have this kind of certification. This is, for sure, not always the case but this can definitely help.

There are already plenty of resources available but I wanted to share my way of doing.

# My background
At the moment, I have four years of experience in .NET C#, doing mostly desktop applications.

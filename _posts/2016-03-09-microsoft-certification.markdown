This is a first post part of a short series about how to prepare some Microsoft Certifications.


## My opinion about certifications
Let me make this  clear I don't think certifications are making in any way a developer better at coding. So I do not think that they are in any manner, necesserary. 

As a matter of fact, in the past I used to be an interviewer for a couple of .NET developer positions in my previous company and among the candidates there were some people who passed the certifications that actually were not necesserarily the best applicants, technically-speaking. Honestly, I do not care that much about the degree BSc, MSc CS or not, what matter the most to me is being competent at programming. To some extent it is more relevant to check one's Github profile and have a look at the repositories in order to find out whether the candidate is capable, progamming-wise.

However, despise the fact that the certifications (whether they are issued or not by Microsoft) are not necesserary to be competent at coding (hopefully), they can still somehow help you to land on your new job. Sometimes, recruiters or HRs are most likely to find you on say LinkedIn when you have this kind of certification. This is, for sure, not always the case but this definitely can help.

## My background
At the moment, I have four years of experience in .NET C#, doing mostly desktop applications with some SQL databases. In the near future I am willing to change a bit and do more web development. I do not really like the idea to get stuck in the past doing some legacy maintenance (come on... Winforms desktop apps, ooch!) or to be overdependent on a certain hardware like doing smartphone apps. I would rather like having an "abstracting layer" even though it requires to do some [Javascript] =/ or one of its superset like... hmm [TypeScript] =]

## What's on the menu?
Well there are already plenty of resources to teach you the dos and dont's, so let's go with a recap, FYI this is of course already available on the [Microsoft Certification 70-483 Exam Official Website].

Let's have a look at the skills and / or the knowledge that the exam is supposed to evaluate:

# Manage program flow (25%)
- Implement multithreading and asynchronous processing
- Manage multithreading
- Implement program flow
- Create and implement events and callbacks
- Implement exception handling

# Create and use types (24%)
- Create types
- Consume types
- Enforce encapsulation
- Create and implement a class hierarchy
- Find, execute, and create types at runtime by using reflection
- Manage the object life cycle
- Manipulate strings

# Debug applications and implement security (25%)
- Validate application input
- Perform symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Manage assemblies
- Debug an application
- Implement diagnostics in an application

# Implement data access (26%)
- Perform I/O operations
- Consume data
- Query and manipulate data and objects by using LINQ
- Serialize and deserialize data
- Store data in and retrieve data from collections

Among the resources that Microsoft is suggesting to take (and eventually) pass the exam, there are:
- This video on [Channel 9]
- The book [Programming in C# Exam Ref 70-483]
- Another book, [C# in Depth]
- MVA Training 
- And mostly at that point, my own practice of the language over 4 years...

## Let's dive deep in the preparation!
Please consider that the preparation that might good for me is not necesserary the case for you, so think twice before complaining about this training-guide.
